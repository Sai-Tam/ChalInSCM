For example, 00580346 has repeatedly adopted new roles, quickly contributing and taking over special tasks and challenges. Prior to joining corporate strategy team, 00580346 has ensured an active exchange with his predecessor with a keen interest to gather as many insights as possible. Due to this intense preparation, 00580346 covered the routine tasks very quickly and took up the lead role in the quarterly OD benchmark BoD paper with an impressing and recognized quality. 00580346’s openness to learn new topics and processes was reflected in the continued support of major corporate portfolio projects and he volunteered in activities beyond his role, e.g. BASF 4.0 activities. In his most recent assignment as a Product Manager for industrial specialties, 00580346 has proven that he is able to transfer the above-mentioned competencies also into a business role extremely quickly. In addition to the regular product management tasks, he has proactively developed a sound business plan for the part of his portfolio associated with the upcoming BASF Colors & Pigment carveout, becoming quickly accepted within the cross functional team. Taking over responsibility for additional product groups after 6 months, 00580346 has already proven in his first year in the current position that he can handle a far more significant business portfolio. However, with his brilliant intellectual capabilities and extremely fast thinking, he can sometimes be too fast for his coworkers and teammates in his daily communication. Nevertheless, 00580346 regularly requests feedback, and this should provide the necessary basis for him to adopt his communication more stringently to the affected audience, which will be important for a managerial role that is highly recommended as a next step.;18.05.2020;E-CIE;CI

00597137;5;D;A-CIA;M;"00597137 has performed at a high level in his first leadership role and his first delegation. As the Process Manager in BPC BDO Complex, he has stepped into his first leadership role and immediately demonstrated ownership for the technical and personnel topics. At the time of his arrival the complex had just received ‘red’ responsible care audit which requires a re-audit within one year, he stepped into the coordinator role, developed the plan to address the deficiencies, continuously tracked and drove the implementation and delivered transparency to the management team of the progress. The resulting re-audit was a ‘green’. 00597137 is curious and driven towards continuous improvement, during the RC Audit preparation he was actively challenging internal processes and ensuring they were sustainable to maintain the required improvement. 00597137 has grown rapidly as a leader; he has been very effective in developing others and shown an empathy towards their individual situations. In this manner he has also developed himself where his focus has broadened to a wider perspective where he is driving improvement in others and the organization overall. 00597137 is result and goal oriented and manages stakeholders/network effectively to achieve his targets. When technical issues arise in BDO he utilizes his contacts in CIT directly, while keeping the RBU and BPC (including commercial contacts) well informed. An example of this is related to catalyst performance issues, possible catalyst poisoning and optimization of the plant. He is an excellent communicator and will flex his style and content based on the audience, from detailed discussions with content experts to executive summaries for higher management. Even though 00597137 does not have day to day responsibility for the production, he demonstrates full ownership for the topics. In a case of an underperforming Production Manager, 00597137 discussed with the Senior Manager and the GM actively proposed solutions and helped to drive a replacement. With the situation in BPC BDO primarily being focused on returning to sustainability, 00597137 has not had the opportunity to demonstrate his capability to drive Innovation. 00597137’s continued development would benefit from leading a larger team directly responsible for day to day production in his next step.";10.07.2020;A-CIA;CI
00601510;5;D;NA;M;"Bayo demonstrated considerable learning agility and leadership potential in both his prior role at EHS and the current NA staff role. He is keen to take on new challenges even if linked to new fields of expertise and sensibly reaches out to a network of leaders for guidance and coaching whenever needed. During his time with EHS he played a key role in the global community across a highly diverse and remote team and had been leading a team of regulation specialists before joining the staff role. More recently Bayo took over the overall implementation lead for project Darvac, a key initiative to make value chains more reliable across various business units. While clear commitment on the overall objective exists across all units the implementation has its own coordination challenges due to many connected sub-projects as well as conflicting targets with regards to capital prioritization. This challenge has been well addressed by Bayo as well as a recent deep-dive analysis on structural improvement needs at the Geismar site. His next role should bring Bayo closer to operations and prepare him for a bigger responsibility at our sites; a side-step into business management represents a viable alternative, too.";25.08.2020;NA;

Further, 00824357 engaged her team to consistently improve the quality, and thus it was possible to acquire new customers e.g. Sto Innovation. The team structure was a highly diverse mix of various cultures, experience levels and competencies which 00824357 had to deal with. She learned how to benefit from this diverse group and it turned out that this was a key point for success of the project. The tight schedule, which was partly changed at short notice by the customer, required a high degree of flexibility and improvisation. Due to her friendly and constructive manner, she always succeeded keeping the team motivated. In parallel, she took over the responsibility for a second laboratory. She was able to expand her expertise by implementation of a highly reactive system. 00824357 was also accepted very fast into this team and appreciated as a competent contact person.

Vice versa, she also managed the various responsibilities for RAP/OC and the RAP department (web side for RAP, communication circle, summer course 2018). In all off these activities she was highly motivated, delivered results in time and used the chance to expand her network. While working on the Circular Economy Roadmap, she quickly became familiar with a new topic. Clear responsibilities within the team, the ability to compromise and strict time management are important for the fast and successful implementation. She was able to moderate multiple different arguments and interests, she structured complex interrelationships and enriched the discussion bringing in new aspects derived from her broad network.

For ex, the work she did in developing the roadmap for BASF’s Inclusion Plan. She embraces diverse perspectives and engages well with team members. Her consistency is evidenced in all her rotations and is acknowledged by her assignment managers. Eagerness to Learn: 00864333 is eager to learn and experience new things. While strong in execution, her comfort level with driving change seems a bit tentative. In her digitalization implementation project with EM, she was hesitant to push back on those with differing opinions. She has potential to be a change champion, but this wasn’t fully demonstrable so will need additional development. 00864333 has clear focus and determination to achieve her individual goals and objectives. However, there is missed opportunity for her to deepen her curiosity and engage with others to also change and achieve their goals.

People Orientation: 00864333 is self-reflective, open to feedback and listens to others. She is aware of the need to improve her executive presence and her ability to influence. 00864333 understands the value of formal and informal networks but could work of proactively leveraging these to shape and influence teams. Area/s for Development: 00864333 tackles tasks quickly but needs to better understand conceptually the correlation to the bigger picture, especially those outside of what she’s being tasked with.

00480536;5;R;CLN;F;Cathy’s status is actually more than Ready Now: the role she will take over as of July 1, 2020 used to be a L4 role – and she was picked for that role while it still was a L4 role. Due to the downgrading decided by the North America organization, she is now doing the same role on a Director level. During her delegation, Cathy moved from being a team member in the Innovation & Technology Policy team to becoming the Team Head. All of the other team members had applied for the role, so she moved into an extremely challenging leadership task. She handled this challenge with great sensitivity and leadership. She involved the team in designing the new set up jointly, gave the team members the required freedom and within a short time established herself as the respected team head. Cathy shows a very strong strategic sense coupled with strong people and networking skills. During her time in Brussels, she expanded BASF’s advocacy activities on new technologies (e.g. 3D printing) and created new insights and connections for the relevant business units.

Cathy has all the basic equirements to be working on a L4 position as of now. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Cathy has been an outstanding leader with the Regulatory Law and Government Affairs group, displaying the ability to engage in all three areas of our group—Product & Trade, Environmental and Government Affairs. She had displayed excellent leadership capabilities in taking the Associate General Counsel position for Product & Trade and leading that group, while being the primary lawyer for trade compliance. She also was leading the BASF Government Affairs activities on trade policy. Her ability to function effectively in these contexts brought the opportunity to take a delegation in BASF Government Affairs in Brussels, responsible for Innovation and Technology Policy. Her abilities were recognized there as she was promoted to head of that group upon the vacancy of leadership of that group, extending her delegation. Cathy has an ability to analyse complex challenges and situations, and has consistently demonstrated an ability to communicate BASF positions in a clear and concise way. Her input is well-respected and highly valued, both internally and externally. She was outstanding in the Washington DC arena in setting up BASF networking opportunities with external government and association stakeholders. For development, there are two areas of focus, one of which is being addressed in part by her delegation. The first is exposure to the broad range of issues that BASF is involved in on policy matters. Her original focus was on trade policy, but with her delegation is getting broader exposure to a range of issues, such as biotechnology and agriculture issues. Similar expansion of knowledge into other areas of BASF, such as environmental and regulatory policy issues, were beginning in her role as Associate General Counsel for Product & Trade, but should be increased.;16.03.2020;COM/G;COM

00623103;5;D;ESE/F;M;00102628 has done a tremendous job within EB and has developed on the professional and personal side from rather a specialist to a global general management role. He has over the past 2 years built up a complete global EHS, Quality Product Safety and trade control organization of close to 100 people. He has shaped the introduction of S4 Hana in his area of responsibility and developed a global governance and service framework for the to be carved out construction chemicals division. He has frequently presented his concepts to the top management of the division successfully. As a result, EB is benchmark in the industry when it comes to EHS performance and has improved under his leadership continuously. In EHS it is hard to strike a good balance between entrepreneurial drive and governance, however after some first months of orientation in EB (coming from a very different environment) 00102628 has taken on many tasks that were completely new to him and has driven them all successfully home. As example he has driven the global matrix certification together with external auditors to make sure on Day 1, everything is ready. Second example would be the development and implementation of a global process and machinery safety as well as explosion protection organization. Based on the created and implemented procedures all 120 production sites fulfilling process safety requirements. Third example would be the set up of global trade control system directly implemented into S4 system. The system is up and running and trade control experts are available to solve blocks and support business to fulfill legal requirements. He has continuously taken his global team along the journey of the carve out and despite significant attrition (many people have decided early on in the divestiture proves to stay with BASF) he has always kept morale on a high level, motivated people to work long hours when needed and filled the gaps with very high personal workload as well as creative ways of using internal and external resources to get the job done. 00102628 is a very self reflected personality who is aware of his strengths and development needs. He is actively seeking opportunities to develop further and he does not shy away from new and challenging tasks. He is willing and able to move to a broader leadership role. One area of development is the communication especially on top management level. He should try to keep the messages simple, concise and find the right level of messaging (assuming top management is not in the details). This has already developed positively over the past 12 months, but probably needs some more hands on experience. He would certainly benefit from continuous exposure to top management. Although EB would have liked to keep him for the long run, he decided to stay with BASF. On a personal note, he is the most innovative and most driven EHS responsible I experienced in my last 14 years at BASF.;10.07.2020;EB;
00106493;5;D;CMT;M;"00106493 00106493 has matured to a highly respected Production Manager, both internally as well as in the site operations community. He proved that he is at any time fully capable of stepping in as plant manager when needed, taking responsibility for a ""complex BASF plant cluster"" (Adipic Acid) – even during times of a total shutdown and necessary re-start procedures of the plant. He is not only technically very verse but in addition leads investigations and initiates corrective measures after severe process safety incidents (e.g. dust explosion). He was a crucial driving element to the mindset change towards a strong safety culture (reduction of LTI and PSI) and sparked a noticeable change to a higher motivated team. The success from technical and structural measures taken by the team can be seen e.g. by the significant reduction of unexpected plant losses from >10% to a sustainable level below 1 %. His movements are always well thought through. With his strong and constant steadiness, 00106493 can overcome major obstacles, e.g. change of crystallization parameters (much better quality, but catchier for operators) or recently the implementation and extension of APC (advanced process control) accompanied by a huge demand of change for the plant operators. He also supported the cluster manager during implementation of unpopular structural measures (20% head count reduction). 00106493’s strengths are not only seen in the long run. In crisis situations, he often demonstrated his ability to quickly take (the right) decisions. This is backed by his flexibility and ability to think on his feet, e.g. DCL-unloading station planned within one month (incl. approval) to prevent AKS plant shut downs. Throughout the last years, 00106493 has further developed his leadership visibility. Due to his Asian descent, he is at first sight often perceived as friendly but somewhat reluctant and therefore undervalued (surface impression). Once people have gotten to know 00106493 better and are able to understand this cultural aspect, there is no doubt about the strong impact he is delivering.";13.04.2018;E-CMP;CM

He proactively identifies innovation potential needs. He quickly adjusts to new tasks and approaches them flexibly: When he started his project in Mumbai, the start-up labs did not have a suitable chemical storage software system. By his own initiative he established a state-of-the-art storage system that is in the meantime highly appreciated by the Navi Mumbai team. His curiosity within his research area enables him to deliver “out of the box ideas” and stimulates his team colleagues who then often proceed in his proposed way. 00134997 as an outsider to the Quinoline project came up with a competitive, outstandingly short and innovative synthesis proposal for advanced candidates, enabling phase promotion to 1b. Close interaction with the project team led to significant reduction in COGs. In Navi Mumbai, 00134997’s major project was the identification of new Qo-Inhibitors to control resistant soybean rust. For this task, he developed a crucial target test in a brain-storming between biochemists, modelers, and molecular biologists, which resulted in development of a valuable in-house assay technology nominated for AgroScience Award 2017. 00134997 is able to see and use the potential in other colleagues to assist him on his projects.

Shortly after joining CPN, 00595557 became a member of CPN’s Coaching and Development team, which focuses on developing the people leadership skills of CPN’s organization. Since early 2017 he led that that team until his role was transfered to CM in 01/2019. In his current role (Dir. Comm. Ops & BD), 00595557 has a challenging task to evaluate long term investment strategies for Basic Petrochemicals, prioritize growth opportunities, negotiate agreements with difficult partners and lead his team of specialists supporting all business managers for N-CPN/B. He immediately contributed by providing the necessary economic view of several settlement negotiations with the BTP JV partner, TOTAL, as part of the negotiation strategy and preparation of BASF's senior executives involved. Prior roles include EO and PO Business Manager (N-CPN/B), his first experience in a business management role, with P&L responsibility which he quickly tackled the challenges with great confidence. For instance, he has taken on the project lead for a feasibility study with Dow for a potential joint HPPO investment in NA. Prior to that, as Strategic Planning Manager, 00595557 mastered a series of new professional challenges such as coming to grips with cracker technology and optimization, long term contract negotiations and difficult JV discussions. 00595557 has been always keen to step out of his core responsibilities and to take on new challenges such as renegotiating the cracker technology license agreement in connection with a major investment project.;06.01.2020;N-CPN;CP
00595557;5;R;A-PMA;M;The strategic roadmaps for Consumer Industry across Asia Pacific, required the transformation of a Commodity minded organization into solution and design orientation. 00595557 accomplished this by setting clear targets & expectations to his sub team leaders operationally as well as addressing required personnel changes in the team. Motivation of the team was always high due to gains from low hanging fruits whilst not neglecting long term objectives. Cross segment and cross industry collaboration are key to Consumer Industry success and moving people from Sales, to Technical roles and moving them into R&D roles has helped to infuse the entire A-PMA organization in China with collaboration for innovation. Non-compliance has zero tolerance and 00595557 delivers on that goal by immediately taking action when discovered which in a few cases has led to dismissals. Driving people’s entrepreneurial spirit, he actively promotes colleagues to form teams and to participate in the BASF GRIPS competition. For 2 years in a row BASF Consumer teams have reached the final round finishing with the highest scores of finalists. Now colleagues are engaging with the largest multinational corporations where BASF had no business in the past, finding solutions that seemed not possible. E.g., we now have substantial business with customers like Huawei, Lenovo, Vivo, Ferrero, ANTA, IKEA. A High-Performance Organization and culture is key for long term growth and 00595557 executes on this by eliminating low performance by training, rotation or if required by dismissals. 2018, 2 low performers separated, 2019 1 further separation. Delegation of responsibilities is key for driving high performance, however 00595557 does support the team if his broad operational experience can lead to a faster solution and solves conflicts. He actively steps in mitigating in cross divisional conflicts to the benefit of BASF overall. Many Chinese brands venture out of China but decision-making lies in China. Enabling and empowering the account managers to act regionally or even globally is creating opportunities for employees and BASF. Therefore, 00595557 established a China Transplant Account Manager to take care of the increasing number of footwear accounts that migrate to ASEAN where local colleagues depend on the drive of this account manager to gain the business for BASF. 00595557’s actively coaches our Global Key Account Manager for Haier and Huawei utilizing his international experience and network.;03.05.2019;A-PMA;PM

The positive growth achievement attributes to efforts of non-Hyundai.Kia engineering plastic projects, hunting at key Korean tiers such as Mantec, SL Yantai, Unitechni and LS Automotive, a successful PU business regain strategy in China and India, as well as significant new business growth in Europe with share shift and new projects SOP in 2019. 00257856’s strong customer focus has led to a successful engagement with NVH HQ in Korea where there are number of projects currently collaborating with NHV in Asia, Europe and Russia. For instance, we have recently secured the first PU engine cover at Hyundai Motor in China which will have a significant multiplying effect globally with more than 2kt business opportunity. Over time, he has also established strategic customer sense and relationship with key customers, by building strong relationships with key decision makers across levels and senior management not only in South Korea but in China and India as well. This strategic relationship allows BASF the potential to further expand business in the region beyond Korea. In terms of people development, his open and supportive leadership style has made him a good people manager where he provides coaching to his direct reports on a regular basis whilst focusing on their development needs and supporting their career development, for instance; enhancing positions that contributes to larger scopes and position enhancement (upgrading) as well as promoting BASF wide topics on cross-OD KTT support which resulted in the delegation of 00826649 Park from Ultrason team to Indonesia to support new business growth opportunity from Hyundai Indonesia new plant and other Korean businesses. His pragmatic approach and support provided to China KTT has succeeded in managing all KTT customers without losing a single customer despite lack of KTT manpower in 2019.";10.08.2020;A-PMA;PM

00135594;5;R;Ress. I;M;00135594’s most striking feature is his passion for business, his extremely strong entrepreneurial drive. He is very persistent and would never give up to pursue his goals even in times of strong internal and external resistance. In his last position, e.g., he was able to break up the oligopolistic situation in the Acetyls market in Europe by establishing a Chinese supplier with a very creative and innovative approach: as these supplier did not have the financial strength and international commodity trading know-how to enter the European market, he set up a portfolio of 10 European customers incl. BASF and linked the price plus a BASF trading margin to contract with the Chinese producer. BASF profits both from lower raw material costs and from an additional trading margin, which was supplemented with additional benefits from BASF bringing feedstocks to the Chinese supplier (project value 100 Mio USD). As the above mentioned example shows, his openness to new things allowed 00135594, after decades in the energy environment, to successfully enter the commodity chemical business and swiftly develop expertise in this business and its logistic value chain as well, making him a very rare and valuable combination of an energy expert with deep chemical market and industry knowledge Currently, BASF is pursuing an acquisition project in the range of 1 bn € which is almost entirely due not only to 00135594’s entrepreneurial drive but also to his empathy for people both inside and very much also outside of BASF, which enabled him to build a vast network in the industry. Only via this network, we were able to approach the market leaders in the industry in a top management level, which resulted in a very fast progress in the acquisition negotiations. All this was only possible because 00135594 also took responsibility to train and develop new team members of RES1/P in energy markets, these coworkers now act as the backbone of BASF’s energy expertise. 00135594 is one of the few people on the job market with long term experience (> 15 years, inside and outside of BASF) in energy markets in combination with knowledge of the chemical industry and chemical commodity business and logistics. He will be a key person for BASF to build up an own energy business particularly in the field of renewable power and power and certificates trading as well as power procurement, which is essential for BASF’s strategic target to optimize the energy/chemistry interface.;01.12.2020;Ress.

In acetylene operations, a project was implemented, which saved >1 Mio €/a be replacing natural gas by off-gas. Due to his strong personal drive and customer orientation he finalized two contracts on acetylene licenses with a contract value of 20 Mio €. Subsequently he led the respective engineering projects. In 2008 he developed a technology strategy and R&D Roadmap for acetylene. The formerly triggered R&D projects are now at the verge of full-scale plant trials and shall be implemented in the new acetylene plant from 2022 on to allow recovering 7 t of steam per t acetylene with an overall benefit of ~14 Mio €/a. After his return to R&D in 2009 as senior research manager in safety engineering he built up and developed a diverse and global high-performance team and ensured high reliability and high Quality of work also during very high work load and the pronounced increase of headcount (from 35 to 55 FTE at LU + 12 FTE oversea). The hired personnel showed an above average performance in the department, however, also several people were integrated and developed successfully in his team, which underperformed in other groups. Critical situations with peak demand, e.g. incomplete safety data in the course of investment projects (e.g. Firebird, Safety upgrade of the SVM plant or DEKA 100) or after incidents (e.g. loss of MS Waldhof or explosion at Landeshafen Nord), were handled confidently and very professional. Prioritization was balanced with other work, which by nature was safety related also, and, therefore, required to maintain the license to operate. Very close contact to ODs was and still is a critical success factor. Likewise, he is using feedback proactively to improve himself. In 2011 he developed together with a colleague from FT a R&D strategy for one of the five clusters of EFo Technik, which already had a strong focus on digitalization. This strategy was updated regularly and in 2016 transferred into the KTC Advanced Processes and Manufacturing. Many of the derived projects were directly implemented in operations or transferred to operating divisions, e. g. design criteria for detonations with savings of > 10 Mio € in 2015, greybox modelling and reliability center. In 2017, he took over responsibility for the group reaction engineering based on his thorough experience and knowledge in safety and safety related reaction engineering. The repositioning of the group and its interaction with other departments and postdoc centers was initiated.

He seeks, appreciates and leverages the diversity in his team, is an active listener and strives to unite viewpoints and bring harmony through open dialogue. He seeks feedback and acts on this, but he provides as well feedback in an objective and constructive manner. On the downside, this may create difficulties for him if this harmony cannot be achieved when facing more harsh characters or when a decision has to be forced where unanimity could not be achieved. 00871953 is very pro-active; he does not shy away from a challenge and whenever he volunteers for a task, he is very diligent and responsible / accountable for the execution. This means that over the years he was open and received quite a lot of opportunities for growth through delegation or assignment, in line with his ambition to develop. His focus tends to go to operational implementation, in line with his wide expertise in biotech and diligent management skills. He should as a consequence be careful not to delve too much into details but rather preserve the bird-eye perspective. He needs in his further development more direct exposure to business so he can develop a vision in line with business needs and move more beyond operational implementation. Painting a motivational forward-looking picture to rally people behind such vision is also a communication learning that will have to accompany this further development. 00871953 is currently happy with his recent new role as Head of Plant Discovery and still sees room for development and creating value. Specific development actions for the near future would preferably allow him to develop his strategic leadership skills and broader view as described above whilst staying in his current role for another 2 years.

Her empathic communication style allows her to build strong personal connections and reinforce her effectiveness as a leader. Until very recently, she has been a Group Leader in Trait Research for the past 5 years, which has modest reporting line responsibility (less than 10 people). Nonetheless, she has been recognized as a Talent during the past 3 years with potential to advance 1 or 2 levels in Trait Research in the mid-term. As support for 00876741's people leadership skills, she was asked to lead the ""Change Champion Network"" during divestment of 00645518 S&T assets to BASF and led a global community of 60 scientists to drive change initiatives to benefit the transition process.

When he feels a lack of progress he vividly inserts himself in a hands-on manner. 00610745's high level of subject matter expertise and strategic business understanding is repeatedly solicited by a broad range of internal and external stakeholders like customers and international business delegations. 00610745 should continue to drive BASF's Data-to-Value efforts towards a sustainable solution anchored in a solid IT infrastructure and backed by behavioral change of all users.

It is his first international assignment with the BASF group and the first time to lead a larger team. He has very quickly and successfully immersed into his tasks, culturally adapted by quickly learning the local language and gaining respect inside his team and outside of Portugal from his respective stakeholders (i.e. his disciplinary reporting line to the CCH Iberia, his operational reporting line with the sub-regional manager of the AP business). Internally, he took emphasis on people development, streamlining processes (i.e. Strata grading, talent identification, succession planning, compensation system), but also initiating replacements in key positions to drive a culture change and to obtain better and sustainable results. Externally, he showed a strong presence with customers, but also with other relevant stakeholders (i.e. German Embassy, DIHK, ANIPLA) increasing presence and acknowledgement of BASF Portugal as a social body and contributor in the community. 00610745 very much profits from and utilizes well the opportunities in BASF Portugal to learn about leading and being fully responsible for an enterprise. He is able to sharpen his good business acumen by gaining broader experience in an operational job (managing customers, building up sustainable bonds amongst business partners, but also dealing with more difficult and unpleasant tasks like i.e. fully executing a dunning process or implementing strategies that will be of benefit for BASF, but might be rejected by internal employees or external partners). Despite his rather young age he is well respected as a leader due to charisma and the respectful leadership style he is applying. He surely will profit to stay in his current role for another 18-24 months gaining more experience and also being able to harvest the results of his efforts.;27.03.2020;EUS;EU

This led to a launch of 6 new product platforms until mid-2018. Since July 2018 he is assigned as sales head for non-key account business with P&L responsibility for his customers in the semiconductor industry. He has started to experience the voice of the customers and starts to become a strong advocate for customers in our organization. 00475503 has been instrumental in pushing forward price increases while maintaining market shares in a challenging market environment. With his focused approach he has been able to increase the absolute gross margin of his customer portfolio in 2019 compared to prior year despite lower customer demand of non-key accounts in the semiconductor industry. 00475503 is balanced, robust and reliable in driving for success in an engaging and inspirational environment. When he recognizes that the situation gets into a locked situation he consistently seeks for solutions with new proposals. He continuously evaluates how his team members can contribute to the targets.

When taking over the plant management of the Lysmeral plant as a first leadership role, she showed her strength in developing an organization from a number of individuals to an effective and highly motivated team, making use of her orientation on people’s strengths and needs.

In all situations, she keeps a high grade of creativity and is able to consider even unusual and innovative solutions. Soon after taking over the leadership of the site Illertissen, 00561028 demonstrated her strategic capabilities and identified that her team was overwhelmed by the vast number of small and midsize capex projects and thus didn’t get anywhere. 00561028 prioritized with her team all projects and coaches them to adhere to that priority list.

In addition, 00602220 has formed a team which has been very successful not only by exploiting earlier key competencies but also by constantly exploring new technologies. 00602220 manages external stakeholders like audit etc. very professionally in a very mature and excellent way. 00602220 also was able to build trust with the team so that bad practices that had been covered up for a long time were brought to his attention freely and could be dealt with in a trustful and transparent matter.;30.09.2020;E-EVP;EV
00134149;5;E;RB/T;M;00602220 is a broadly recognized expert in the field of toxicology (e.g. diplomat of the American Board of Toxicology, Board member of the Germany Toxicological Society, member of the EU Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits), demonstrating an unusual international acceptance of his toxicological knowledge. He has (co)authored > 150 publications and in 2016 became an official lecturer (privat Dozent) at the Free University of Berlin. He continuously strives for improvement, with a tendency to perfection. 00602220 initiated and coordinated more publicly funded projects than anyone at RB/T, also one of the highest at BASF Group level. He connects and involves different BASF groups with his vast academic network and various universities and has additionally established excellent relationships with governments and NGOs. Within BASF he was one of the drivers for the sustainable development of nano-materials and is internationally considered an expert on this field. He has experience in regulatory toxicology from his work in Ludwigshafen and RTP. In Japan he established the first group of regulatory toxicologist in the country which required both cultural understanding as well as leadership skills to ensure that tough decisions were implemented. He has made significant contributions to the development of new test methods by his enthusiasm for new ideas, but also ensured change of direction if this was needed to either obtain the objective or to abandon unsuccessful projects. He has achieved long term goals such as the acceptance of newly developed alternative methods by EU agencies as well as OECD. He is highly committed and expects the same of his co-workers. Although his excellent analytical skills occasionally result in straight-forward voiced conclusions, he nevertheless has integrated a diverse team into a very efficient group.;14.05.2020;RB/T;RB
00131298;5;R;ESE/S;M;00602220 has started his job as Head of Operational Safety Services in July 2017 out of a deep-rooted interest in the topic and as a development step towards leadership functions in operations. Although his former management was critical towards his change to ESE, he followed his belief, that this is the right job and development for him. This is very typical for 00602220, as he is strong in analyzing a situation, developing an opinion and strategy and, once a concept is thought through and discussed, consequently pursuing it. Already after only about 10 months in his new role he has achieved a visible and quite drastic change in his team, that had barricaded itself in a rather conservative, bureaucratic, risk adverse and therefore internally often criticized mentality. Based on his leadership experiences in his former assignment as Senior Production Manager of the Wax Plant in LU (full disciplinary leadership for around 50 people), he has established a clear team structure, clear responsibilities and a developing openness of mind – asking for a spirit of cooperation instead of silo-expert-knowledge. This achievement can only be properly assessed when knowing that his three predecessors had failed at this task. To be so successful in this difficult task, he could build on his experiences made in his former assignment, acting out of a Senior Production Manager role like as a fully responsible plant manager. The older, “official” plant manager was not willing to drive the necessary changes shortly before his retirement. He mastered this difficult situation very successfully in balancing his activities properly to achieve the changes necessary to transfer the Wax Plant and their employees to the future setup without losing the trust and the support of the “official” plant manager. 00602220 is strong in taking personal responsibility, as he is taking up discussions even knowing that he will have a hard time convincing his counterparts. He did so when introducing new EHS requirements, such as LU-R-OSA 003 or the new risk matrix. When discussions about safety aspects of the new AGV’s (Automated Guided Vehicles) in 00705425 got rough, he took over himself, visited the engineering partner company and discussed a way forward, including internal and other external partners. Although he is consequent in his principles, he has a distinct aspiration to do things cost effectively for BASF. 00602220 has a sharp and clear strategic mind-set which enables him to identify easily the pro and cons of alternative strategic pathways. As an example, he acted very successfully as focal point for all safety related HPO activities in 00705425, designing a new cooperation model and respective argumentation. He cooperated closely with the global EHS HPO team and lead successfully the preparatory discussions with the operation units to foster and to prepare the final decisions by the management.;25.02.2020;ESE;ES
00244318;5;D;G-ECT;M;00602220 has been challenged out of his comfort zone. He moved to a broader leadership position – all EHS disciplines – from his former Product Safety environment. He clearly demonstrated his ability to always look for new ideas and approaches to foster and shape development needed to enhance EHS performance. Under his leadership, the site Schwarzheide started to discuss and take into account that “human factors” are most important to be considered, when it comes to root cause analysis. He is a quick “adopter” to learn new methods and tools from others and how to make them useable @ the site. He has strong analytical and also strategical competencies, which he demonstrated by developing a modified QSGU-Management Concept for the site. He faced some difficulties implementing his fresh, dynamic style into the somehow “concrete”, established culture in Schwarzheide. He pushed his people, not everybody was able and/or willing to follow, which sometimes led to frustrating experiences. 00602220 was able to cope with those frustrations and never lost his enthusiasm and positive motivation. With the establishing of EUU, 00602220 was giving the task to lead the EHS personnel in the south-east Region of Germany (14 smaller sites) in addition to his task in Schwarzheide. 00602220, again showed to be dynamic by immediately jumping into action and visiting all the sites, gaining an overview about their needs. Here, he was much more successful than within the above-mentioned culture in Schwarzheide.In terms of leadership, 00602220 is best when he finds a dynamic environment, where new ideas are needed and where more strategic issues apply. On the contrary, 00602220 would not find his best effectiveness in a more regulated “boring” environment.;28.03.2018;EUU;EU

Additionally, 00602220 has stepped up in his role as the Peony Project Production Director to show that he can manage complexity and multiple BASF and third party interfaces. e.g. between the Freeport site our JV partner YARA and the contractor KBR. He has managed conflict and competing interests professionally and developed his negotiation skills in his current role for example in renegotiating a complex terminal contract with Lemm Corporation. 00602220 has further demonstrated managerial courage in upholding safety standards during the commissioning and start- up phase of the project. When the contractor KBR had life threatening safety violations despite prior warnings from his team, 00602220 pushed for and ultimately convinced Senior Management to shut down the construction site and sent all KBR contractors home, despite threats from KBR for millions of dollars. 00602220 is developing well towards future roles that will expand his scope or stretch his breadth such as new plant construction in other regions or site management. 00602220's developmental opportunity is to develop his communication style to be more direct, clear and concise especially when communicating upward.;13.04.2018;N-CMN;CM

He received an excellent education as a chemist at leading universities both in the US and Germany. Before joining BASF he worked in central research at DuPont, focusing already on the development of new homogeneous catalysts. In his nearly 25 years with BASF he developed tremendous expertise in his field, not only in R&D but also in production/technology. After his first years in research at Ammonia Lab he moved to production where he was in charge of commissioning and start-up a new production line of the Oxo-plant (based on new technology). Since more than 15 years he is leading the research group “homogeneous catalysis” at GC and has shaped this field of research for BASF. His outstanding expertise in industrial research on homogeneous catalysis is recognized internally and also externally. His experience in the field of developing new homogeneously catalyzed processes, especially with regard to catalyst recycling in large scale continuous processes, is unique within BASF and also beyond. He is the go-to expert in this field within BASF and a sought-after speaker at international conferences. He has been very influential in the continuous optimization of the Oxo technology – a key technology for CP and one of the largest scale petrochemical processes based on homogeneous catalysis. Applying Oxo synthesis to new products has been a continuous task of his group leading to new production processes for CP. Additionally, he has been able to transfer his know how in the field of Oxo synthesis to fine chemicals. He developed a totally new hydrogenation of citral opening the road to a new production process for the aroma chemical Menthol that has meanwhile been realized. This asymmetric hydrogenation is the largest of its kind in industry, and for the first time ever a continuous recycling of the precious chiral catalyst has been applied in an industrial process. Under his leadership BASF’s first industry-on-campus laboratory was founded at Heidelberg University (CaRLa) which was a role model for other labs to follow. Here the focus is on breakthrough new catalytic transformations (“dream reactions”) that could give BASF a competitive advantage in an ever changing environment of regional feedstock availabilities (e.g. Acrylate ex CO2 and ethylene).;04.11.2015;RCS;RC

Having joined BASF through the 00645518 seeds & traits acquisition, he was new to most of the BASF colleagues, especially in LU. He could quickly build up trust to win their hearts and minds despite facing some difficult change management topics. For example, the process of moving his former 00645518 team to a BASF corporate group was very controversial. With his subtle, dialogue-based conflict management skills the process has been very well managed. A second example was how Roger communicated and implement the strategic decision to discontinue the team lead positions in the group (first career step for young talents). Severe travel restrictions made it even more challenging to develop interactions and build trust. By continual personal discussions with diligent follow up and a group workshop he created openness for the new strategy and jointly developed a perspective for the group. As North American regional representative in the GDB leadership team, Roger is the spokesperson for a number of US-based teams which are not part of his disciplinary or functional accountability. He has very quickly connected to these team members personally and gained their trust and respect. Roger is voicing their interests and concerns with empathy and passion.

She joined CDS in 2017 with a focus on improving Group-wide transparency in R&D resource use and allocation. Despite her finance and business administration background, she quickly gained a profound, content-focused understanding of BASF’s R&D activities, structures and processes, earning her a natural authority in the innovation chain community. On top of that, she supported various projects (e.g. R&D Leadership Journey, Corporate Strategy) and handled strategic controlling for AP (complete SBUs with all business aspects) with surprising ease. In addition to her existing tasks, 00035363 took over the responsibility for BASF’s R&D management tool PhaseGate in 2018, including functional leadership of two employees. In all her assignments, 00035363 has quickly taken over tangible ownership and delivered results beyond expectations. She leverages her broad network with an open, collaborative and solution-oriented working style. Colleagues on all levels are regularly seeking her advice, as she brings a good dose of common sense to any discussion. Despite continuously increasing workload and responsibility, 00035363 maintains and spreads a positive, motivating team spirit. With these characteristics, 00035363 already proved clear leadership talent and skills on an informal level.

00035363;5;D;AP/C;F;00035363 has consistently been one of the strongest contributors in the AP controlling community for many years. She is an extremely rapid responder and reliable and autonomous contributor. As an example, during her role as controlling lead for the 00645518 integration, she has successfully and persistently brought together controlling, finance, legal and tax in order to create tangible benefits for BASF in particular in the course of the final settlement of the purchase price and post-closing negotations (e.g. inventory claims). As a consequence of this strategic leadership impact, benefits for BASF in the higher double digit €m range were generated via tax optimization (intelligent allocation of purchase price to different tax jurisdictions) and the reduction of the purchase price resulting in savings of immediate cash out for BASF. During this integration controlling role, 00035363 was functionally leading one team member. She successfully contributed to this team member's professional development in a way that ultimately enabled him to obtain a team lead position in another OD controlling organization after the end of the integration project. In her new role as lead of business evaluation and strategic controlling for AP she had to deal with the case of a skilled but highly demotivated employee. She has successully stabilized this situation by building on the fact that she was the new leader, aiming at a 'fresh start' and giving this person particularly complex and highly value adding tasks to rebuild identification and motivation. Both examples show 00035363's capability to have people leadership impact by developing talent and building impactful teams also in difficult situations. In her most recent role, 00035363 strongly builds on her deep operational knowledge of the AP business and the corporate processes around commission F and S projects. In doing so, she is particularly successful in steering also the new parts of the AP organization, who are not too familiar with BASF yet, towards consistent business cases, high quality commission papers and as successful as possible approval processes. A strong example for operational leadership impact. 00035363 is aware that it would be positive for her to complement her strong leadership impact with even stronger 'executive presence' and she is actively working on this.

00578781;5;E;RAD;M;"00578781 00578781 is a highly experienced and very solution oriented scientist who wants to get things done. In his career, he has always been eager to learn and broaden his knowledge base, and therefore accepted different international assignments. After being responsible for the research group ""architectural coatings"" in Shanghai that achieved an impressive track record of new product developments under his leadership, we promoted him to the position of a Center of Exellence (CoE) Head for ""polymers for construction"" in summer 2018. In this role, he is directly heading a research group at RAD as well as a development group at A-EDA in Shanghai. In addition to these two roles, he is coordinating the R&D activities in this specific field across the regions (global R&D budget of ~15 million EUR), fostering exchange and driving global topics. 00578781 clearly sees the need to further advance our technologies. He pushes for technology topics in the field of ""polymers for construction"", building on intense dialogues with the marketing units. On top, he became the key player for initiating dispersion related KTC projects at the IC Shanghai. 00578781 is a demanding and strong leader for R&D teams, communicating clear expectations to his team members while coaching them in case he sees deficits. As a very dedicated leader he wants to see his team members grow and build up the necessary capabilities to tackle complex problems on their own. He has proven to be successful with this approach already twice at the IC Shanghai, forming powerful R&D teams. Not shying away from tough decisions, he had to handle low performing lab managers and could successfully replace them to strengthen the team. Overall, 00578781 shows very high persistence in achieving his targets and could be perceived as a bit ""pushy"", also due to his intellectual power. He should thus work on his communication skills, especially by integrating the views of others into his considerations and argumentation lines. As a next step, he should take over the leadership of the RAD/EDD platform “New Product & Process Design” at IC Shanghai (as successor of 00014008 00014008). In this role, he will further grow and shape the technology portfolio of RAD/EDD to become an Executive Expert.";16.12.2020;RAD;RA
